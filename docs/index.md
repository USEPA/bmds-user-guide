# Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS) User Guide

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Benchmark Dose Software
(BMDS) was developed as a tool to facilitate the application of
benchmark dose (BMD) methods to EPA hazardous pollutant risk
assessments.

EPA risk assessors use the models in BMDS to estimate reference doses (RfDs), reference concentrations (RfCs), and cancer slope factors, which are used along with other scientific information, to set standards that protect human health from the effects of chemical exposures.

A specific focus of BMDS is the estimation of a statistical benchmark dose (BMD), including bounds (e.g., 95% confidence intervals) on such estimates. The BMD is a chemical dose or concentration that produces a predetermined change in the response rate (i.e., the "benchmark") of an adverse effect, such as weight loss or tumor incidence.

This user guide provides instruction on how to use BMDS but is not
intended to address or replace EPA BMD guidance. Every attempt
has been made to make this software consistent with EPA guidance,
including the Risk Assessment Forum's (RAF) [Benchmark Dose Technical Guidance Document](https://www.epa.gov/risk/benchmark-dose-technical-guidance).
([U.S. EPA, 2012](https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm?action=search.view&reference_id=1239433)).
